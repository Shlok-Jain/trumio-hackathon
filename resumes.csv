Key Projects • Image Segmentation using K-means algorithm (Oct 10;22) – The image is partitioned into multiple segments based upon the number of clusters which is defined initially. The k-means algorithm is written from scratch and as the number of clusters increase the new image obtained tends to the original image. The image is actually a 3D matrix consisting of RGB channels, which is converted into a 2D matrix by using the python reshape function. – The2D matrixhas3columnswhichcorrespondstoRGBvaluesofeachpixel. Thentheinitialcentroidsarechosenfrom these pixels randomly and centroids are calculated iteratively. – The gifs present in the folder found on opening the link helps in visualizing it nicely. • Sentiment Analysis using CBOW and TF-IDF (Dec 1;22) – FedasmalldatasetofrestaurantreviewstotheWord2Vec Models(CBOW,TF-IDF)andfittedthevectorizeddatainto multiple classification models like Logistic Regression,KNN classifier,SVM, AdaBoost,XGBoost Classifier etc.. and obtained an accuracy of approximately 75 percent on the testing dataset for positive or negative reviews. • Volume control using Hand Gesture (April 9;22) – With the help of OpenCV we detect the hand landmarks, then we calculate the distance between the thumb tip and index finger tip. The distance is within the range of 30-350, and the volume range was within -63.5-0.0,so scaling was done, to resolve this issue. – The python audio control library Pycaw is used for controlling the audio of the device based upon the distance between the tips of thumb and index finger.The machine learning library MediaPipe is used for extracting the key points of the fingers. – Technical Skills • Programming Languages and softwares: Python, C++, C, HTML, CSS, Javascript • Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Keras, Tensorflow,Pytorch, OpenCV • Relevant Courses Introduction to Machine Learning,Coursera Introduction to Deep Learning, Coursera CS224n CS231n Scientific Computing with Python, FreeCodeCamp Programming and Data Structures Linear Algebra, Numerical and Complex Analysis Probability and Statistics Position of Responsibililty • Student Member,Kharagpur Data Analytics Group (Feb 20;22 - Present) – Presented a white paper on non-linear dimensionality reduction methods like t-SNE,UMAP to all members of Kharagpur Data Analytics Group which included alumnis as well. Also used these dimensionality reduction meth- ods on the MNIST dataset and discussed the results.Also discussed about the Barne’s Hut algorithm. Presented a white paper on various object detection algorithms like R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, SSD, YOLO.Discussed the differences between these algorithms and compared their efficiency. – Extra-Curricular

Internships and Projects • Research Intern | National University of Singapore,Singapore (Dec’22- Feb’23) Mentor: Prof. Chaithanya Bandi, Analytics and Operation, NUS. - Implemented code in Python to integrate the Open AIs Application program interface (API) and leverage on NLP tasks - Shipped in 1081 chemistry papers to extract relationships using crosslingual coreference, hugging face, GPT-3 from long texts - Integrated the MATKG, a large-scale multilingual knowledge graph, into relationship extraction pipeline to improve depth • Research Intern | Qatar University,Qatar (Apr’23- July’23) Mentor: Prof. Maode Ma, Cyber Security, Qatar University - Conducted research on security enhancements in the context of Internet of Drones, testing and debugging security mechanisms -Exploredsmartedge,anendtoendencryptedframeworktosecuretransmissionofmultimediastreamsamongclouddatacentres -SimulatedtheprotocolinScythertool&Networksimulator-3tocalculatemetricsintermsofdatatransferrate&responsetime - Successfully devised and implemented security enhancements, contributing to reduction of

-ImplementedtheIMDB’sweightedratingformula,incorporatingfactorslikeaverageratingsandvotingdistributionforamovie - Utilized Count Vectorizer to create the count matrix and applied cosine similarity to calculate the similarity between movies - Used the surprise library which uses algorithms like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to minimise RMSE (Mean=0.8978) • Vehicle Detection Model | Self Project (Aug’21-Sep’21) A Deep Learning model to detect and count the number of vehicles in a real-time video - Located the moving objects by applying frame differencing and finding the pixel difference on every pair of consecutive frames - Generated the contours in each frame after applying image thresholding to find the shape and boundary of the moving vehicles - Boosted the results by performing image dilation on frames to make sure that any single vehicle is not counted more than once Competitions • Gold Medal | Data Analytics | Gymkhana Championship | IIT Kharagpur (Mar’22) To predict future sales of a fan company using time series forecasting - Patel Hall of Residence - Performed EDA to look for patterns like seasonality & correlation in provided dataset of 1039 time series with 38 data points -Addedrelevantfeaturestodatasetusingdatapreprocessingmethodslikenormalization(min-maxscaling)&featureengineering - Explored various ML regressor models like Decision Tree, Gradient Boost, Lasso ,Elastic Net and plotted their MAPE scores - Formulated Neural Ensemble method to find the best possible sales predictions and achieved the median MAPE score of 0.1 Technical
